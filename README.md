  + `TN1`/`TN2` - Switching to the first/second operand buffer
  + `BR` - Reading a number from the buffer
  + `BW` - Write number to buffer
  + `C` - Cancellation buffer
  + `<x` - Removes the rightmost digit from a number
  + `Stack mode` - Switch from buffer mode to stack mode. For example, enter 2+2, enable stack mode, press =, 4 will appear, now if you continue to press =, 2 will be added to the result of the previous operation.
